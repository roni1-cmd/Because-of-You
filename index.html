            <div class="preface-text">
              <p>I've been meaning to write this for a while—not because I think I can capture everything I feel, but because I want you to know how much you actually mean to me. This isn't a love letter full of clichés or perfect sentences. It's me, messy and honest, trying to put into words what you do to my life without even trying.</p>
              <p>It's not filled with clever lines or dramatic speeches. It's just me, trying to be honest, messy, and real. It's my way of putting into words the impact you have on me, on my life, and on the way I see the world. You make ordinary days extraordinary, moments unforgettable, and even the small things in life meaningful. You've given me more than I can say, and I want to at least try to tell you that.</p>
              <p>So, what follows isn't perfect. It won't be flawless, and it might sound simple or clumsy at times—but it's all true. Every word comes from the part of me that knows that my life is better, brighter, and infinitely richer because of you. I hope when you read this, you can feel even a little bit of the gratitude, awe, and admiration I carry for from the moment I said "I love you".</p>
              <p>May these words find you exactly when you need them most.</p>

              <p><span class="drop-cap">D</span>ear Vyein, I keep trying to describe you, but words always fall short. You're beautiful, yes, in the obvious ways—your smile, your eyes, the way you move. But it's deeper than that. It's in the small things no one notices. How your hair falls across your face when you're thinking. How your lips twitch slightly when you're holding back a laugh. How your voice softens when you're passionate about something, or how it's calm and steady when you're comforting someone. Those little moments, the ones that feel too small to matter, are the ones that leave me completely captivated.</p>
              <p>You have this energy about you, this presence that makes the world stop, even if only for a second. I catch myself staring sometimes, not because I'm trying to, but because I can't help it. I want to remember everything about you—the way you tilt your head when you're curious, the way your hands move when you talk, the way your laughter feels like it's lighting up the room. You're alive in ways that make me want to slow down and notice the world the way you do.</p>
              <p>And it's not perfect. You're human. You have doubts, worries, insecurities, and that's what makes it real. That's what makes it hit harder than any surface-level beauty ever could. The way you exist, completely unfiltered at times, makes everything around you sharper, softer, warmer, and brighter. Every time I see you, I'm reminded that beauty isn't just about looks—it's about the way someone inhabits the world, and you do it like no one else.</p>

Ordinary days feel extraordinary when you're around. A simple walk, a quiet afternoon, a random conversation over nothing at all—they all become memories I can't stop replaying. I catch myself smiling over nothing, just thinking about something you said, or the way you laughed at something silly. That's how you touch my life—you make ordinary feel alive.</p>
              <p>Even when life is heavy or stressful, just knowing you're there makes it lighter. Challenges that normally feel overwhelming suddenly feel manageable, because somehow, your presence makes the world feel softer. You bring colors into my life that I didn't even know were missing. You make quiet moments feel safe and loud moments feel exciting. You make me notice the little things again—the way sunlight looks through a window, the sound of rain hitting the roof, the way a song can hit differently when you're thinking of someone you care about.</p>
              <p>You make me feel things I didn't know I could. You make me want to experience life fully, to notice everything, to hold on to every moment. Even when we're apart, I find myself looking forward to the next time I see you. You've made my life richer, fuller, warmer, and somehow simpler all at once. And the crazy part is, it's not because of anything you do—it's just who you are.</p>

I'm stubborn and impatient and a lot of times I don't say what I feel when I should. But with you, it doesn't feel like I have to be perfect. I can just be me, and somehow that feels enough. You make me want to be better—not for anyone else, but because being around you makes me want to live up to the way you see the world. You make me laugh even when I don't feel like it, you make me think about things I usually ignore, and you make the messy, complicated parts of life feel manageable.</p>
              <p>I think about the future with you, not in some big, dramatic way, but in small, perfect moments. I think about mornings where we sit together drinking coffee, talking about random nonsense until the sun is high in the sky. I think about nights where we stay up too late, lying awake and just being together without needing words. I think about afternoons where nothing is happening, but everything feels alive just because you're there. Those little things—they're what I want. That's what matters to me.</p>
              <p>You make my life feel fuller in ways I never imagined. You make me feel like living is beautiful again. You make me hope and dream and care about things that I had stopped noticing. You make me feel like I belong somewhere, like there's a place where all the chaos of life doesn't matter as long as you're in it.</p>

There are days when that absence is loud, when it sits with me and reminds me that wanting someone doesn’t automatically mean having them. The distance is real, and pretending otherwise would be dishonest.</p>
              <p>There are moments I wish I could show you things instead of describing them. Times when I wish I could sit beside you instead of imagining you somewhere else, living in a different place, under a different sky. Sometimes it’s frustrating how close you feel and how far you actually are. That contrast can be exhausting.</p>
              <p>But even with all that space between us, you’re present in my life in ways that surprise me. You show up in my thoughts throughout the day. I catch myself wanting to tell you things immediately, even before I realize how automatic that impulse has become. Distance hasn’t muted you. It’s sharpened you.</p>
              <p>If anything, being apart has made me more aware of what you mean to me. I don’t take your attention lightly. I don’t take your time for granted. When someone matters to you from far away, you feel it clearly, without confusion or convenience masking the truth.</p>

              <p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>hat I admire most about you is the way you exist so naturally, as if you don’t need to announce yourself to be felt. You move through the world with a quiet confidence, not loud or demanding, but steady and real. People sense it, even if they don’t know why. I sense it every time you speak, every time you pause to think, every time you choose kindness without making a show of it.</p>
              <p>You have a depth to you that reveals itself slowly. The more I learn about you, the more I realize there’s always something beneath the surface. You’re thoughtful in ways that matter, observant in ways that feel rare, and intentional without being rigid. You don’t rush through life, and that makes me want to slow down too.</p>
              <p>Watching how you handle things, even from afar, teaches me more than you probably realize. You face situations with honesty, even when they’re uncomfortable. You don’t pretend to have everything figured out, and that sincerity feels grounding. It reminds me that strength doesn’t have to be loud.</p>
              <p>What draws me to you isn’t just attraction or affection. It’s respect. You make me admire the kind of person you are, and that admiration only deepens the more I see how you move through the world, how you think, and how you care.</p>

            <div class="chapter-text">
              <p><span class="drop-cap">Y</span>ou’ve become part of my everyday life in ways that feel effortless and real. You’re there in my thoughts when something good happens and when something goes wrong. I find myself wanting to share experiences with you, even the small ones that seem insignificant at first glance. They matter because you matter.</p>
              <p>There’s a comfort in knowing you’re part of my life, even if we’re not in the same place. It’s not loud or overwhelming. It’s steady. You make me feel understood without needing constant explanation. Being able to talk to you, to be honest with you, feels natural in a way I don’t take for granted.</p>
              <p>You don’t crowd my life. You enrich it. You fit into it in a way that feels balanced and grounding. You bring warmth without pressure, closeness without demand. That kind of presence is rare, and I recognize how lucky I am to have it.</p>
              <p>Some people enter your life briefly and leave little impact. Others stay in ways that reshape you. You’re the latter. You’ve carved out a space in my life that feels secure, meaningful, and deeply appreciated.</p>
